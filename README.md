# Beat
Beat is a web application created for a fictitious client to demonstrate my ability to create a modern blog layout. This fully responsive web application also includes a functional archive page for users to search past blog posts. There are six main components of the website: Global Header, Articles, Archive, Popular Content, Newsletter Sign Up, and a Global Footer.
